      <p>Over my 2B school term, I am working with an Electrical & Computer Engineering Professor to research synchronization primitives for next-generation Non-Voliatile RAM. Currently, I am working on adapting an open source project done by Microsoft Research group, which implements a persistant multi-word compare-and-swap primitive for NVRAM. I chose this project because I am very interested in the area of synchronization, especially as it relates to databases and distributed computing.</p>

      <p>
        During my second work term at Nymi, I led the development of a critical reliability <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/mt158211(v=vs.85).aspx">Windows credential provider</a>, a low-level interface called by the Windows Login Subsystem for biometric authentication and login with the Nymi Band. Since I had knowledge of the credential provider from my first co-op term, I was responsible for updating the entire application to a new asynchronous Bluetooth service and a new enterprise server API with token-based authentication. Over the course of the term, I was given a lot of independence and opportunity to experiment, which led me to learn a great deal in the process of developing a robust and effective solution. For more information about my second work term at Nymi, check out my <a href="resume/aeweston-wtr.pdf" target="_blank">Work Term Report</a>.

      <p>
        During my first work term at Nymi, I worked on the Lock Control and Nymi Enterprise Manager applications. I was responsible for adding several new features to the Nymi <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/mt158211(v=vs.85).aspx">credential provider</a> and improved the rate of successful logins to over 95%. I implemented a core component of the credential provider: a NFC service which allows users to tap their Nymi band against a smart card reader to identify themselves to the computer and login automatically. I also refactored the interface used for communication with the Nymi band in order to support multi-terminal login and remotely created credentials.
